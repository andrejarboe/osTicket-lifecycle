- In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket. 
- The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business. 
- We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. 
- In some ticketing system customers can set their own SLA plans.
